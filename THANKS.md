## The Remmina community

Without the  **Remmina community**, this project wouldn't exists outside its owner workstations.

## The Remmina core team

**Antenore Gatta** ([antenore](https://github.com/antenore)) and **Giovanni Panozzo** ([giox069](https://github.com/giox069)) to have resurrected Remmina, without them,
it would be a dead project!

Long life to Remmina and their maintainers!

media expert.

## Most active collaborators

functionalities to Remmina.

## The fathers of Remmina
