{"name":"Remmina","tagline":"The GTK+ Remmina Remote Desktop Client","body":"<h2>About the Remmina Project</h2>\r\n<p>Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be useful\r\nfor system administrators and travellers, who need to work with lots of\r\nremote computers in front of either large monitors or tiny netbooks.\r\nRemmina supports multiple network protocols in an integrated and consistent\r\nuser interface. Currently RDP, VNC, NX, XDMCP and SSH are supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remmina is released in separated source packages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"remmina\", the main GTK+ application</li>\r\n\t<li>\"remmina-plugins\", a set of plugins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Remmina is free and open-source software, released under GNU GPL license.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"content\"><div class=\"padding\">\r\n\r\n<h2>FAQ - Background</h2>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><span class=\"faq-q\">Q:</span>\r\nWhy did you start this project?\r\n</dt><dd><span class=\"faq-a\">A:</span>\r\nThe whole story started from my new netbook Eee PC.\r\nI bought it and installed Debian on it.\r\nI really enjoyed it until I realized that the default installation of\r\nthe RDP client 'tsclient' on Debian is quite annoying for me:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Eee PC has very small screen resolution,\r\nbut it won't allow me to scroll when I am connecting to my desktop.\r\nI can move the window by pressing Alt, but I have to disable capturing all WM key bindings,\r\nand it means no Alt-Tab in remote desktop. This made me crazy.</li>\r\n<li>In fullscreen mode, it occupies all my virtual desktops and provides no control.\r\nI can do nothing else when I am connecting to my desktop. When I roll my desktop cube, RDP is in all sides.</li>\r\n<li>I had great experience with Krdc, which is part of the KDE project.\r\nBut in order to install Krdc in Gnome desktop, I have to install tons of additional dependencies;\r\nThis is obvious not a good news for a small netbook user, or a Gnome fan.</li>\r\n<li>Remote desktop is one of the most frequently used application to me in my netbook;\r\nI have to look for a perfect solution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWell, if you happen to be in the same boat as me, I hope this is the place you are looking for!\r\n</dd>\r\n<dt><span class=\"faq-q\">Q:</span>\r\nWhy the name &quot;Remmina&quot;?\r\n</dt><dd><span class=\"faq-a\">A:</span>\r\nThis is mostly personal preference. :) But just for you to easier remember it, it can\r\nalso stand for Remote Mini Assistant.\r\n</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<h2>FAQ - Usage</h2>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><span class=\"faq-q\">Q:</span>\r\nWhere are all my connections and preferences stored?\r\n</dt><dd><span class=\"faq-a\">A:</span>\r\nEverything is placed in a hidden directory <code>.remmina</code> under your home directory. It will be created\r\nautomatically with <code>0700</code> permissions.\r\n</dd>\r\n<dt><span class=\"faq-q\">Q:</span>\r\nCan I start a connection using a shell command?\r\n</dt><dd><span class=\"faq-a\">A:</span>\r\nYes, use <code>remmina -c filename</code>.\r\n</dd>\r\n<dt><span class=\"faq-q\">Q:</span>\r\nHow are my passwords stored? Are they secure?\r\n</dt><dd><span class=\"faq-a\">A:</span>\r\nThey are encrypted using 3DES with a 256bit randomly generated key. You should keep your\r\nkey secure.\r\n</dd>\r\n<dt><span class=\"faq-q\">Q:</span>\r\nWhy you don't use GNOME keyring?\r\n</dt><dd><span class=\"faq-a\">A:</span>\r\nI would like to keep the main program GTK+ only so non-GNOME users, especially XFCE users, can use it.\r\nHowever, with the plugin system it's possible to implement GNOME keyring support as a separated plugin.\r\nRight now it's just a matter of whether there are actually demands out there. So if you think this is\r\nimportant for you, please let me know!\r\n</dd>\r\n<dt><span class=\"faq-q\">Q:</span>\r\nWhere can I find some documentation?\r\n</dt><dd><span class=\"faq-a\">A:</span>\r\nRemmina was designed to be hopefully work for most people without the aid of any documentation.\r\nBut if you want to find some technical information, the\r\n<a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/remmina/index.php?title=Main_Page\">Remmina Wiki page</a>\r\nmight be useful.
